## Research Experience  

+ **2017.08 - 2017.11**  
**Natural Language Processing based Recommender System**
	- Based on a Coursera corpus, used language models such as LSI and LDA to recommend courses to Coursera learners  
	
+ **2016.10 - 2017.05**   
**Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews in NLTK Movie Reviews Corpora**
	- Firstly used basic machine learning methods(Na√Øve Bayes, logistics regression, SVM, etc.) to classify the sentiments 
	- Then implemented word embeddings, MLP classifier, etc. to solve the sentiment analysis problem

+ **2016.11 - 2017.02**   
**Image Classification of the MNIST Database** 
	- Constructed basic CNN and RNN structure based on tensorflow to solve the MNIST classification problem

+ **2016.05 - 2016.08**   
**Application of Empirical Likelihood for Statistical Analysis(MSc. dissertation)**
	- Implemented empirical likelihood method on various datasets and made relevant statistical inference from univariate mean to regression parameters 
	- Successfully proved that the empirical likelihood approach was more data-oriented than the parametric methods 

+ **2016.01 - 2016.02** Researcher   
**Production Plan Optimization of a Laptop Company(Coursework)**
	- Used R, Arena to explore the distribution of time spent in every phase of the plan 
	- Built the simulated system via Arena, estimated the production time of every laptop and optimized the whole system to decrease the cost
  
+ **2015.10 - 2015.11** Researcher   
**Production Plan Optimization of an Oil Company(Coursework)**  
	- Decreased the running cost of that oil company by constructing better production plan using Excel and Xpress 
	- Based on the output of Xpress, produced applicable advice, worked out a result which could improve the profit by 6% approximately

## Work Experience  

+ **2016.10 - 2017.04** Research Executive  
**Department of Automobile, Ipsos Beijing, China**  

	- Specialized in the research of whole automobile market and market segment, the evaluation of product and its positioning, the analysis of competitors, etc.
	- Used popular Python based modules such as nltk, sklearn to do sentiment analysis of customers' web comments on popular Chinese car brands 
	- Used R packages (rvest, RCurl, etc.) to design web crawler from scratch and got useful raw data. Completed data visualization tasks using popular R packages(ggplot2, corrplot, etc.)
