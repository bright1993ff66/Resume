## Research Experience

- **2020.5 - Now**  
  **Traffic Relevant Weibo Detection and Analysis in Shanghai**
  - Use [Weibo API](https://open.weibo.com/wiki/API) to crawl the Weibos posted near Shanghai in 2012 
  - Manually label the collected Weibos and train the deep learning models such as ```CNN-LSTM``` and ```Transformer``` based models to detect the traffic relevant Weibos
  - Based on the detected traffic relevant microblogs, conduct traffic relevant Weibo analysis, characterize the areas with high density of traffic events through text mining
- **2020.3 - Now**  
  **Traffic Information Recommendation Using Graph Neural Networks**
  - Use [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) to collect tweets posted in major US cities in 2018
  - Based on user's historical interaction with traffic relevant messages in social media, build the graph between the social media users and places
  - Use Graph Attention Network to encode the user-place graph and make traffic information recommendation
- **2018.11 - 2020.5**  
  **Evaluate the Influence of New Transit Stations on Nearby People in Hong Kong**
  - Use  [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) to collect tweets posted in Hong Kong from May 2016 to December 2018
  - Use [ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview) to find the tweets posted in the walkable distance (500 meter) around the new transit stations
  - Use sentiment analysis to estimate the sentiment of tweets posted near transit stations. Evaluate the influence of new transit stations on nearby people by comparing the sentiment and number of posted tweets before and after the introduction of transit stations

## Project Experience

- **2018.10 - Now**  
  **Crawl and Manage the Tweets Posted in 27 Cities Worldwide**
  - Set up [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?ec2-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ec2-whats-new.sort-order=desc) instances and used [Twitter Streaming API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) to collect the tweets posted in major cities worldwide, including US cities(Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, etc.), European Cities(London, Madrid, etc.), and other major cities(Taipei, Bangkok, Tokyo, etc)
  - Monitor the tweet collection process on a daily basis
  - Saved the collected tweets to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and local server for the following analysis


## Work Experience
