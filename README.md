## Research Experience  

+ **2017.08 - 2017.11**  
**Natural Language Processing based Recommender System**
	- Based on a Coursera corpus, used language models such as LSI and LDA to recommend courses to Coursera learners  
	
+ **2016.10 - 2017.05**   
**Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews in NLTK Movie Reviews Corpora**
	- Firstly used basic machine learning methods(Na√Øve Bayes, logistics regression, SVM, etc.) to classify the sentiments 
	- Then implemented word embeddings, MLP classifier, etc. to solve the sentiment analysis problem

+ **2016.05 - 2016.08**   
**Application of Empirical Likelihood for Statistical Analysis(MSc. dissertation)**
	- Implemented empirical likelihood method on various datasets and made relevant statistical inference from univariate mean to regression parameters 
	- Successfully proved that the empirical likelihood approach was more data-oriented than the parametric methods
